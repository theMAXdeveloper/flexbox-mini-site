          <h2>About me!</h2>
          <p><strong>Hi, I'm Rick James B****.</strong> Rick James’s rise to fame in the 1970s was marked by a series of triumphs and triumphs that were, in hindsight, gloriously absurd. His hit single, “Super Freak,” was a global sensation, primarily because it managed to be both insanely catchy and an anthem for anyone who had ever tried to impress their friends by dancing on a table. It is said that when Rick performed this song live, the sheer force of his charisma was so intense that it could be seen from space—though only on nights when the cosmos was particularly foggy.<br><br>Rick’s concerts were renowned for their sheer unpredictability. At one particularly infamous show, Rick attempted to perform a "flying leap" off the stage, which led to the creation of the now-popular stunt, “The Rick James Paradox”: where you jump high, but gravity insists on reminding you who’s in charge.</p>
